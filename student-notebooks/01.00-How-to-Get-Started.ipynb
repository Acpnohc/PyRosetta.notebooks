Besides manually building it from the Rosetta C++ source code, the general way to obtain this is through the use of a `conda` environment. \n",

    "A `conda` environment is a way to run code that has specific versions of required packages, that instead of being installed globally, will be installed as a local virtual environment that you may run whenever you wish. This is extremely useful when some packages require specific versions of other packages, as is the case for some rosetta distributed code. \n",

    "**NOTE:**\n",
    "When using a notebook with this env - the python **Kernel** must be set to this env.  *In Chapter 15 and other parellel notebooks, this is done for you*, but if you wish to use this environment in other notebooks, make sure to run conda manually change this!  \n",
